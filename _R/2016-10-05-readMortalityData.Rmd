```{r, echo=FALSE}
options(replace.assign = TRUE, tidy = TRUE, width = 110, scipen = 4, digits = 3)
```

Reading  fixed-width text files might be challenging, specially when we don't have a dictionary file. In this post, I show steps to read CDC files in a more systematic way. In this example, I import a compress mortality file (CMF 1979-1988) available [here](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/cmf.htm) and  whose codebook (or layout) is [here](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/mortab/filelayout68_88.pdf).

To read this file, usually with extension `.txt` or `.dat`,  I first need to know where each column starts and finishes. What I get from the pdf file is something like this:

![](/images/mortalityLayout.png)

The layout is usually a codebook in Word/PDF or just plain text file. Here, I copy the PDF text and put it in a plain text file. I use a text editor (e.g., [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)) and [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) to extract the information I need.

I have to select every row with this pattern: `1-2 2 FIPS State code Numeric`. That is, a number followed by a hyphen (although not always, particularly when the width of the column is one), spaces, another number, spaces, and then any text. I use the following regular expression to get that pattern: `(^[0-9]+).([0-9]+)\s+([0-9])\s+(.+)`. Using the Sublime package [Filter Lines](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Filter%20Lines) I get something like this (you can also just copy the selected lines):

```
1-2 2 FIPS State code Numeric
3-5 FIPS county code Numeric
6-9 4 Year of death Numeric
11-12 2 Age at death Numeric
13-16 4 ICD code for underlying cause-of-death 3 digits: Numeric
17-19 3 Cause-of-Death Recode Numeric
20-23 4 Number of deaths Numeric
```

This approach might be particularly useful when you have a long PDF/Word file and you want to extract most of the variables. You would need to adapt the regular expressions I'm using to the particular patterns of your codebook.

To simplify, I format this text as a comma-separated values file (csv). Replacing this regular expression `([0-9]+)(-)([0-9]+)(\s)([0-9]+)(\s)(.+)(\s)(Numeric)` by `\1,\3,\5,\7,\9` I get:

```
1,2,2,FIPS State code,Numeric
3,5,3,FIPS county code,Numeric
6,9,4,Year of death,Numeric
11,12,2,Age at death,Numeric
13,16,4,ICD code for underlying cause-of-death 3 digits:,Numeric
17,19,3,Cause-of-Death Recode,Numeric
20,23,4,Number of deaths,Numeric
```

Then, I read the layout file:

    ```{r}
    # define names of columns
    colnames <- c("start", "end", "width", "name", "type")
    dict <- read.csv("data/dictMortality.csv", col.names = colnames, header = FALSE)
    ```

    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    dict
    ```

Now, I can read the fixed-width data file. I use the [readr](https://github.com/hadley/readr) package (in my experience relatively fast for big datasets ~ 1 GB).

   ```{r, results = 'hide', warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
   library(readr)

   # create name of variables
   cnames <- c("state", "county", "year", "age", "icd", "cause", "deaths")

   # read mortality file
   mort <- read_fwf("data/mort7988.txt", fwf_positions(dict$start, dict$end, cnames))
   ```

   ```{r, echo = FALSE}
   mort
   ```

    ```{r, echo = TRUE}
   # year distribution
   table(mort$year)

   # number of deaths
   sum(mort$deaths)
   ```

Hopefully, this might save you some time!
