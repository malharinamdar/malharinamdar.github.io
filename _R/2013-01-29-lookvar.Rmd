Recently, I have been working with big databases. After reading their codebooks (usually very long pdf files),
I thought it would be useful to have a function to find variable names in R. I wrote a simply function
that looks for variable names in __data.frame__ and __data.table__ objects.

Here an example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
options(replace.assign=TRUE, tidy=TRUE, width=110, scipen = 4, digits = 3)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(devtools); source_gist("4661324")
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(data.table)
```

```{r}
dat  <- data.table(infert)
(var  <- lookvar(dat, c("par", "spon")))

dat[, var, with=FALSE]
```

Pretty useful, at least for me. You can also use _regular expressions_ to get variables, for instance, something like `lookvar(dat, "p5[0-2]_[a-z]+_2")`.
