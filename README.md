# Personal portfolio and blog

I wish to use this website to write and publish anything that I find useful enough to share
including my thoughts on technology, ml, life in general and the lessons I keep learning
along the way.ðŸŽ¯

Suitable options to follow updates on my blogs using the RSS feed is using online feed readers like `feedly`
