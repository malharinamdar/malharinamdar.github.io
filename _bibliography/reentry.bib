Understanding their characteristics and criminal trajectories can enlighten us regarding the different needs of women upon re-entering society after incarceration. Drawing on data from the Reinserci\'on, Desistimiento y Reincidencia en Mujeres Privadas de Libertad en Chile study, this article identifies different profiles among a cohort of 225 women who were released from prison in Santiago, Chile, and demonstrates that significant heterogeneity exists among them in terms of their criminal trajectories and the intervention needs to support their transition out of prison.},

  abstract = {Finding and keeping a job is one of the key challenges individuals face as they move back into society. Research suggests that former inmates access mostly jobs on the margins of the labor market, however there is limited research on the dynamics of post-prison employment that account for differences in types of jobs. Using data from the study ``Reintegration, desistance and recidivism among female inmates in Chile'' (RDFC), our paper describes patterns of employment among a cohort of 207 women released from prison in Santiago, Chile and followed during the first year after release. We use sequence analysis to describe monthly patterns of employment considering different types of work (i.e., self-employed / employed, legitimate / under-the-table). To better account for the complex relationship between work and crime, we include offending as another type of income-generating activity. Finally, we use cluster analysis to explore which individual characteristics are associated with the distinct patterns of employment and offending. Our results show a significant level of heterogeneity in employment trajectories by job type, and the importance of considering work and offending to obtain a more complete picture of the dynamics of employment during reentry.},
