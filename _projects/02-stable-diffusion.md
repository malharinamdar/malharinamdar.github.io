This project involves the implementation of generative models such as text to image, image to image models using the U-Net neural network,
CLIP Encoder and the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for its functioning.

The architecture was implemented based on the research paper present in the repo linked below.

I am adding the notes I have taken while building and learning throughout the implementation of this project.

Sorry for the poor handwriting :)

Hope to post a blog on the topic soon.
