This project aims to classify the drone image capturing the different stage of road construction in 8 different categories
The model classifies the stage of road construction using ResNet model.


This project was a part of SIH Smart India Hackathon where I looked after the team's ML part of the project.

code available at [repo](https://github.com/malharinamdar/road-contruction-monitoring.git)

The 8 different stages include:

•	Category 1: Clearing and Grubbing
•	Category 2: Excavation and Earthwork
•	Category 3: Subgrade Preparation
•	Category 4: Base Layer Construction
•	Category 5: Macadamisation
•	Category 6: Utility Installation
•	Category 7: Road Marking
•	Category 8: Pedestrian Infrastructure
