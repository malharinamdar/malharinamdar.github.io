In this project my initial idea was to implement the the system of mcq generation using T5 Tranformer model 
alongwith BERT encoder transformer based model to synthesise text and generate suitable questions using NLP techniques and we
use the open source BERT model to analyse the text input, but due to the complexities involved and certain constraints I halted the idea.

I plan to implement this idea using NLP techniques soon and update the webapp.

Rather I chose a simpler approach of directly using Gemini LLM model to implement the project. I also plan to add additional features and 
ideas into this project, which at this stage is still a very simple webapp.
