I’m Malhar, an undergrad focusing on neural networks and deep learning, with a keen interest in their applications in health and climate.

My interest in this field draws my attention to research, where I wish to build and design technology that that creates genuine value by solving impactful problems in healthcare and beyond. 

Reach out if you’d like to chat about anything you think we’d both enjoy! Open to research internship positions.
