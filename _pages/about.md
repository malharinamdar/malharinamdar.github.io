I’m Malhar, an undergrad specializing in neural networks and deep learning, with a keen interest in their applications in healthcare and climate.

My passion for this field drives me toward research, where I aspire to design and build technology that creates genuine value by addressing impactful challenges in these domains and beyond.

Reach out if you’d like to chat about anything you think we’d both enjoy! I’m open to research internships, project collaborations, and other opportunities to work on impactful ideas.
