I’m Malhar, an undergrad focusing on neural networks and deep learning, with a keen interest in their applications across different peripherals such as climate and health.

My interest in this field draws my attention to research, where I wish to build and design technology that helps catalyze progress towards an age of abundant intelligence, energy and creativity. 

Reach out if you’d like to chat about anything you think we’d both enjoy! Open to research internship positions.
