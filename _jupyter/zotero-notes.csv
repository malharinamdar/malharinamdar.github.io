Also we can’t test the whole epigenome, arrays cover aprox 450000 CpG sites (1.5%). Many studies are performed in blood cells, which most not likely do not contribute to obesity. The tissue should be carefully selected.","1) Evidence for DNA methylation sites that contribute to increased BMI (overlaps in multiple studies)2) Obesity is associated with differential DNAm and increased epigenetic variability (dysregulation)3) Alterations in DNAm are more often a result of obesity than the opposite4) Diets with higer folic acid alter the methylation pattern of genes associated with obesity and t2d in mice5) Diet affects methylation. Not only overfeeding/fasting, the fat composition affects.6) The epigenetic signature is altered in response to exercise. Epigenetics may be a link between exercise and adipocyte metabolism.",,

Adjusting for cell % reduces lambda in almost every cohort (and also reduces the number of hits when corrected by Bonferroni) a cell may be an important confounder when methylation is measured in the whole blood. Maternal BMI-associated newborn blood methylation sites are not enriched for certain biological processes or pathways.
Associations between maternal BMI at the start of pregnancy and newborn DNA methylation were reproduced in the whole blood of adolescents at most sites","Large sample size n=7523. Strong confounder correction by shared environment or genetics: they used a negative control design in which both exposures (paternal and maternal) were tested. They also correct by using mqtls a if there is evidence of a snp related to methylation changes, there is not a causal maternal intrauterine effect in that one because it could be driven by a shared genetic effect.","Effects sizes were very small, les tan a 0.15% change in methylation per one-unit increase in maternal bmi. The biological significance of such small effects is nuclear. Without integration with gene expression data it’s imposible to truly infer if the results are functionally important.",,,

No need to observed the interacting environment. Environment is defined as a random effect.
Maximum likelihood approach
Software: https://github.com/zkutalik/GRSxE_software",,Interesting approach to GxE and GxG. The method could be used as a tool to establish the contribution of G×E to different traits and subsequently prioritize those with substantial global interaction effect for follow-up G×E analysis with specific environmental factors.,"The interaction effect estimates may depend too strongly on the choice of the fitted link function, thus this application requires further research.
How meaningful is to estimate the interactions this way? We are not able to identify which factors are the important ones.
Some GxE1 may represent G×G1 or E×E1 interactions, where G1 is a genetic factor associated with E1 and G with environment E, respectively. Still, such identified G × E is an informative starting point for further investigations narrowing down the most plausible E.
Mostly useful for polygenic scores analysis (SNP analysis most of the time underpowered)
The method assumes that any outcome heteroscedasticity (conditional on the GRS) is driven by G×E interaction, although it could be due to variance controlling genetic effects.","Simulation results seem to show the method is robust
Application to real data suggests that GxE contribute ~0.1-2% of genetic risk
n = 20,000 studies are well powered.
The heteroscedastic nature of BMI is most likely due to a transformation and not driven by G×E.","GxE are challenging, E is not measured accurately, potential crucial factors are hard to define. They proposed a method to establish statistical interactions between genetic risk (continuous outcome) and all environmental variables, and estimate the total GxE contribution to the trait.
Previous GxE studies indicated that the contribution of G×E compared with marginal genetic effects is very modest (less than a quarter of the explained variance of the marginal model).",What would be the implications of these results to the GxE heterocedasticity discussion?
RGDC9R9R,Abadi et al. 2017,"Genomics, GxG, GxE, BMI",Penetrance of Polygenic Obesity Susceptibility Loci across the Body Mass Index Distribution,Sebastian,Are the effects of obesity-susceptibility loci uniform across the BMI distribution? The study aims to investigate variations in the impact of 37 BMI-associated SNPs across the distribution of BMI.,,"Several studies, including the Framingham cohort (75,230 adults of European ancestry.) Includes &gt;18 and &gt;92. Outcomes: BMI. They describe quality control (QC) procedures. They compute different cumulative gene scores (GS) to estimate also the combined effect of SNPs.","Conditional quantile regression (CQR) to investigate the effects (association) of 37 BMI-associated SNPs at multiple percentiles. Also, meta-regression to combine results. All models were adjusted for age (years), sex (female, male), and study (factor).",,Interesting approach to GxE and GxG.,"European ancestry, how these results hold in developing countries?","Significant positive associations (adjusting for multiple comparisons) between BMI percentile and CQR estimates were detected for 9 of 37 SNPs. Positive meta-regression estimates indicate that the effects of SNPs vary systemically by BMI percentile because unadjusted interactions inflate the impact of SNPs in participants with a high BMI. CQR models for GS-BMI showed steadily increasing effects with increasing percentiles, whereas CQR models for GS-height did not vary across percentiles.
Suppose unadjusted interactions in the effects of BMI-associated SNPs are predominantly due to GXG interactions. In that case, it is reasonable to suppose that these un-adjusted interactions would be detected at a similar frequency in other quantitative traits such as height. On the other hand, if GXE interactions predominate, then these unadjusted interactions might be less frequently detected in quantitative traits with a smaller environmental component (i.e., height).
The simplest explanation for the discrepancy between the results for GS-BMI and GS-height is that the unadjusted interactions detected from GS-BMI were predominantly GXE interactions.","The role of the individual and compound gene-environment and gene-gene interactions in determining BMI (obesity) has not been fully elucidated (data limitations, etc.) FTO (rs1421085) has been shown to jointly interact with diet, physical activity, salt and alcohol consumption, and sleep duration.",What would be the implications of these results to the GxE discussion?
