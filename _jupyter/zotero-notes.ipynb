The idea would be to have your notes in Zotero so that everyone in the group can access and edit them and create a data file to explore your notes using, for instance, text analysis techniques.\n",

For instance, if the location of my collection is `https://www.zotero.org/groups/2406179/csic-echo/collections/M8N2VMAP`, the collection ID would be `M8N2VMAP`. We also need the Zotero API's credentials. \n",
